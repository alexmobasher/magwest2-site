Yes. MAGWest has a one badge per person policy so you will only be able to pick up one badge for yourself.

If you are buying a badge for another individual, we ask that you put that individual’s information into the registration form. This will allow a faster pickup process in the preregistration line, as otherwise we will have to reassign your extra badges before they can be handed out.

You may also use the personalized link in your MAGWest payment received email to change the name on the badge.

If you are buying the badge as a surprise, we still ask that you use the individual’s information when purchasing the badge, but make sure to use your email address so they don’t get the confirmation email.
