We understand that people under 18 often do not have an official photo ID, but please notify us ahead of time at [contact@magwest.org](mailto:contact@magwest.org) to make arrangements.

**This makes it much easier for us to accommodate you.**

If you do not make arrangements with us beforehand and do not have a photo ID, we will do our best but cannot guarantee that you will be able to pick up your badge.
