            <p class="uk-text-large">MAGWest has a giant arcade, stocked full of rhythm games, pinball, consoles, and so much more. Plus, all the machines are free-to-play. We might be a small event, but hopefully so are our lines!
            <br /><br />
            Almost all of the arcade cabinets at MAGWest are brought by individual collectors. If you can get your arcade machines
            to the event and make it available for attendees to play, we'll give you a free three-day badge!
