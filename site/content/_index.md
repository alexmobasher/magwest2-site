# MAGFest presents MAGWest 2018
{{% /div %}}

We've done this for 16 years by running our annual east coast event in the Washington DC area, which has grown to 20,000 people attending over 4 days. We have always had the dream of wanting to take MAGFest global.

Now we're excited to kick off year two of our very first expansion event, MAGWest, in Santa Clara, CA. This event is the first of many MAGFest expansion events. It has been 6 years in the making and the process of creating it has transformed every aspect of our entire organization and everyone in it.

We looked hard to find a city with a vibrant music community and empower them to take leadership positions in MAGWest, and put their own spin on what a MAGFest event should be. San Jose fits that bill perfectly, and we're super-excited to make it the home of MAGFest's west coast operations. It's our hope that MAGFest's presence in the area can be an amplifying force for the vibrant community that already exists here.

MAGFest is powered by people who often work through extreme difficulty, sometimes forging new paths where no roadmap exists, sometimes stumbling and getting back up. We want to break down the walls between staff and attendees and let our attendees create entirely new types of experiences. We provide the space, you guys bring the rest.
