## Do you like console games? We do too. Check out all of your favorites we're bringing!

*GAME ON!*

In MAGFest tradition, the 24-hour Consoles room will be returning to MAGWest for year 2.  Want to speed run an old classic you haven’t played ages?  Or compete in a tournament with people who love that game as much as you do?  Want to _make a tournament happen?_ MAGWest is the place for you!

MAGWest is joined again by [The MADE](https://www.themade.org/) from Oakland and [TBAGR](https://www.facebook.com/TBAGRMedia/) from Sacramento.  For the uninitiated, the *M*useum of *A*rt and *D*igital *E*ntertainment is a “nonprofit dedicated to the preservation of video game history”, not to mention that it’s a really cool place to visit.  The *B*ig *A*nime *G*ame *R*oom has been doing it’s thing since 2007, providing “top-quality game rooms all over Northern California for special events”.  Special events? ♥︎ We think they’re pretty darn special, too.

Together with these awesome organizations, we’ll be offering an array of gaming experiences from Atari to Wii…pending poetic confirmation of a Zemmix.
