## PANELS. We'll have em, if you help.

The inaugural MAGWest had round-the-clock content run by fans, creators, and local hobos. Up to the challenge for 2018? Click [here](https://west2018.uber.magfest.org/uber/panel_applications/index) to apply to run a panel or event. If you're accepted, you'll get a free weekend badge and the feeling of warm fuzzies.
