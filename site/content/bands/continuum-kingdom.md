The Super Soul Bros. are what would happen if you jammed a 70’s Herbie Hancock record into a Super Nintendo.

Based in San Jose, CA, the Super Soul Bros (not “Brothers”) combine explosive funk-fusion and jazz with familiar melodies from classic video game, anime, TV and movie soundtracks. Since their formation in 2012 by keyboardist Robbie Benson, they’ve become renowned for their dynamic musicianship, improvisation, and high energy shows.<!--more-->

The Super Soul Bros have performed across the country, sometimes in a 4-piece “lite” mode, but mostly as a 6-piece band complete with a full horn section. Their performances range between small club venues and giant auditoriums packed with thousands of fans, but they can also provide full entertainment packages for private parties and events. Essentially, they can play for anyone, anywhere.

Whether they’re taking requests on the fly, or the crowd’s busting into a full-on soul train, it’s always a party with the Super Soul Bros!
