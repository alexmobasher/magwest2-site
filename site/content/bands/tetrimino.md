Tetrimino is a four-piece jazz fusion video game band from… the Internet!

With members hailing from both coasts of the US, the band arranges and performs nostalgic video game themes solely through the power of the Inter-webs. Tetrimino primarily releases their arrangements on YouTube along with a video of their performance. The band’s unique music style draws inspiration from their wide musical background including jazz fusion, western classical, rock, and progressive music. Whether it’s virtuoso violin solos, shreddy key runs, intense bass grooves, or thundering drums, Tetrimino has something for everyone.

The band is comprised of Michaela Nachtigall on violin, Kris Salada on piano, Matt Mukerjee on bass, and Mitchell Cairns on drums.
