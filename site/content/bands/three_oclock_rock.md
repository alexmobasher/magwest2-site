3 Oâ€™Clock Rock is an after school music program for kids and adults located in Downtown Oakland, California.  They will
have a student showcase on Sunday of MAGWest in the Jamspace room, last year was pretty rad! Come out support the bay area's
future musicians.

About 3 O'Clock Rock: 
We offer classes in analog recording, drums, guitar, bass, keyboards, cartooning, film production, and group and private 
lessons.  We welcome students from the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.  

Scholarships are available and are sponsored by 924 Gilman Street Project, The Octopus Literary Salon, and 
Abura Ya Japanese Fried Chicken.
