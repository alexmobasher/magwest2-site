We understand that people under 18 often do not have an official photo ID, but please notify us ahead of time at contact@magwest.org to make arrangements â€“ this makes it much easier for us to accommodate you. If you do not make arrangements with us beforehand and do not have a photo ID, we will do our best but cannot guarantee that you will be able to pick up your badge.
